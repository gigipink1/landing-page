# landing-page
This is my attempt at the landing page project for the Odin Project.

I stuck to trying to recreate the sample image as much as possible because my main focus was just getting comfortable with building a website from scratch and using flexboxes effectively. 

Overall quite happy with how it came out! I do need to go back and clean up the css file because there is quite a bit of repetition but once again my focus was more on just getting used to the skills. I actually think the repetition of certain lines was really helpful in building my understanding of the fundamentals.
